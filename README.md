# Quantitative-Finance
A repository of active or partial projects pertaining to computational and quantitative finance.

Aspects of the included projects derive from a multi-asset MVO-like momentum strategy used to allocate personal funds c. 2022-2023 which used GPR and classical approaches for the input params for the portfolio optimisation and used higher moments and drawdown measures for risk targeting. ETF closing prices were retrieved from a MS SQL Server instance with tables populated with AlphaVantage's API but these are made to run from flat files for the sake of replicaiton.
