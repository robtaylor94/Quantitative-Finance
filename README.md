# Quantitative-Finance
A repository of active or partial projects pertaining to computational and quantitative finance.

Aspects of the included projects derive from a multi-asset MVO-like momentum strategy used to allocate personal funds c. 2022-2023 which used classical approaches for the input params for the portfolio optimisation and used higher moments and drawdown measures for risk targeting.
